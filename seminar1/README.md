## Dependencies

## Package installing

For transcriptmics I firstly need to install SRA toolkit.
I have preinstalled conda, so I have created and activated new conda environment:

```{bash}
conda create -n sra_tools python=3.9
conda activate sra_tools
```
On the next stafe I have installed SRA toolkit by conda.

```{bash}
conda install -c bioconda sra-tools
```
